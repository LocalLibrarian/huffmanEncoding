# Huffman Encoding Personal Project
## Description
This is a bonus assignment/side project I made for CP312 at Wilfrid Laurier University in 3rd year. The program can encode and decode .txt files of any length with lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, spaces, newlines, commas, and periods. Also includes various debug functions.
## Requirements
C compiler.
## How to Use
Compile encode.c. Run encode program from the command line with the name of a .txt file in the same directory. A few files will be created, the original .txt will NOT be modified in any way. The actually compressed file is called compressed.bin.

Then compile decode.c.Run decode program in the same directory as the files created by encode. The newly decoded file is called decoded.txt and contains all the same text as the original .txt.
## Future Improvements
- Likely none, as the program is an already submitted bonus assignment
